## Dataset Overview

### Fashion-MNIST Dataset

- **Composition:**
  - Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
  - Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image.
  - Images are categorized into 10 classes (e.g., T-shirt, trouser, bag).

- **Purpose:**
  - A drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.
  - Focuses on fashion items, making it useful for training models on more complex image recognition tasks.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Using Google Colab

- **Access:**
  - Google Colab is an online platform for writing and executing Python code.
  - Requires a Gmail account to use.

- **Integration:**
  - Pull notebooks from GitHub repositories to follow along with pre-written code and commentary.

## Exploring the Dataset

### Visualization

- **Process:**
  - Use code to visualize the images in the dataset.
  - Understand what each class of images looks like and how they are labeled.

- **Hands-On Practice:**
  - Run the provided code to see the images and their corresponding labels.
  - Familiarize yourself with the dataset through visual exploration.

## Image Preprocessing

### Grayscale Images

- **Details:**
  - Images are 28x28 pixels in grayscale, with pixel values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

### Min-Max Scaling

- **Purpose:**
  - Scale pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 by dividing each value by 255.
  - Makes the data easier for the neural network to process.

### Flattening the Image

- **Flattening:**
  - Convert the 28x28 image into a single row of 784 values.
  - This row becomes the input to the neural network.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Layers

- **Input Layer:**
  - Consists of 784 nodes, each representing a pixel from the flattened image.

- **Hidden Layers:**
  - Two hidden layers with 128 and 64 nodes respectively.
  - Help the network learn complex patterns.

- **Output Layer:**
  - Contains 10 nodes, each representing a class (e.g., T-shirt, trouser).
  - The network predicts the class with the highest probability.

### Activation Functions

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):**
  - Used in the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
  - Helps the network learn complex patterns by handling non-linear relationships.

## Training the Neural Network

### Training Dataset and Batches

- **Training Dataset:**
  - The Fashion-MNIST dataset is used to train the neural network.

- **Batches:**
  - The dataset is divided into smaller groups called batches.
  - Each batch is processed separately to make training more efficient.
  - Example: A batch size of 64 means each batch contains 64 images.

### Forward Pass

- **Process:**
  - Input data (images) is passed through the neural network to get predictions.
  - The network uses its current weights to make these predictions.

### Loss Function

- **Purpose:**
  - Measures how well the neural network's predictions match the actual labels.
  - In this case, "sparse categorical cross entropy" is used, suitable for multi-class classification problems.

### Backpropagation and Weight Updates

- **Backpropagation:**
  - After calculating the loss, the network adjusts its weights to reduce the loss.
  - This process involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.

- **Weight Updates:**
  - The weights are updated based on the gradients calculated during backpropagation.
  - The goal is to minimize the loss function.

### Epochs

- **Definition:**
  - One complete pass through the entire training dataset.
  - Multiple epochs are used to improve the model's accuracy.
  - Example: The model is trained for 10 epochs.

### Optimizer

- **Purpose:**
  - An algorithm used to update the weights of the neural network.
  - In this case, the "Adam" optimizer is used, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in deep learning tasks.

## Evaluating the Model

### Accuracy

- **Process:**
  - The model's performance is evaluated by comparing its predictions with the actual labels.
  - The accuracy is checked to identify correct and incorrect predictions.

### Validation

- **Validation Accuracy:**
  - Around 90% after 10 epochs, indicating that the model performs well but is not perfect.

### Identifying Errors

- **Misclassifications:**
  - Find instances where the model's predictions do not match the actual labels.
  - Understand the model's limitations and areas for improvement.

## Key Concepts

### Weights (w)

- **Definition:**
  - Parameters that the neural network adjusts during training to make accurate predictions.

### Loss

- **Definition:**
  - The error between the predicted values and the actual labels.

### Optimizer (Adam)

- **Definition:**
  - Algorithm that updates the weights to minimize the loss.

### Epoch

- **Definition:**
  - One complete pass through the training dataset.

## Additional Insights

### Validation Loss

- **Purpose:**
  - Monitor the network's performance on a separate validation set.
  - Helps in identifying overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

### Learning Rate

- **Definition:**
  - A hyperparameter that controls how much the weights are adjusted during training.
  - A suitable learning rate is crucial for effective training.
